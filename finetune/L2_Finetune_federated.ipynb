    "The config includes the following parameters:\n",
    "- `num_clients`: this refers to the total number of clients involved in the federation. You can think of each client being a different hospital or medical institution. They all want to collaboratively train a single model (an LLM for Medical Q&A in this case) but without sharing their data.\n",
    "- `num_rounds`: Determines the number of FL rounds. This is one of the key hyperparameters in FL, depending on the application and complexity of the model/data, this could sometimes be in the order of hundreds or even a few thousands. In this notebook, you will use two rounds (but you are welcome to change this)\n",
    "- `fraction_fit`: In Flower, the _strategies_ (e.g. `FedAvg` or any other of the many strategies [implemented in Flower](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ref-api/flwr.server.strategy.html#module-flwr.server.strategy)) will sample a number of the available clients. With this parameter, you can configure the ratio of clients to be sampled. In this case is `0.2` which means 20% of the connected clients (i.e. 20) will be sampled in each round. This means that each round `4` clients will finetune the LLM on their local data.\n",
    "- `client_resources`: You will learn how to run a FL simulation using Flower's Simulation Engine. The values in `client_resources` allow you to control the degree of parallelism for your simulation (i.e. how many clients can run concurrently). For this notebook, each client will use 2x CPU threads and no GPU. You can read more about [Flower Simulations](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) in the documentation.\n",
    "- `dp`: This block of the config allows you to parameterize the Differentiable Privacy (DP) component used to finetune the LLM. There are different variations of DP, and in this notebook, you will use DP with fixed clipping as first proposed by [_McMahan et al._ (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06963). The higher these values are, the stronger the amount of noise added is. Higher noise values offer higher degrees of protection but at the expense of reduced model performance. This flavor of DP uses two main hyperparameters:\n",
    "     - `noise_mult` (short for _noise multiplier_): which controls the amount of noise added to the weights after aggregation on the server side.\n",
    "     - `clip_norm`: threshold value to clip the model updates at the client side and after aggregation.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this notebook, you will add DP introducing a small amount of noise since we are prioritising model utility. You can read more about how to use DP in Flower in [the documentation](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-use-differential-privacy.html)."
